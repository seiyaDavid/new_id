Slide 2: The Challenge
"Why Synthetic Data Matters"
Data sharing is essential for innovation
Privacy regulations restrict sharing of sensitive data
Synthetic data offers a promising solution
Key Point: "Synthetic data must balance utility (usefulness) with privacy (protection)"
Slide 3: Our Solution
"Comprehensive Privacy Analysis Framework"
Visual: Screenshot of your application interface
Four-pillar approach:
Generation: CTGAN with adaptive training
Attack Simulation: Membership inference & GAN reconstruction
Privacy Metrics: k-anonymity & differential privacy
Utility Assessment: Statistical similarity & ML performance
Slide 4: Live Demo Walkthrough
"How It Works"
Upload dataset → Generate synthetic data → Run privacy attacks → Analyze results
Key Point: "Our tool provides immediate feedback on privacy vulnerabilities"
Visual: Workflow diagram with screenshots from the application
Slide 5: Privacy Attack Insights
"Understanding the Attacks"
Membership Inference: Can we identify if a record was in the training data?
Key Point: "Attack accuracy of 50% is ideal (no better than random guessing)"
GAN Reconstruction: Can patterns be reverse-engineered?
Key Point: "Higher Wasserstein distance indicates better privacy"
Visual: Side-by-side comparison of attack results with risk indicators
Slide 6: Differential Privacy Impact
"Privacy-Utility Tradeoff"
Visual: Graph showing how increasing epsilon affects utility and privacy
Key Point: "Differential privacy adds controlled noise to protect individual records"
Interactive element: Demonstrate how epsilon slider affects data distributions
Slide 7: Real-world Applications
"Where This Matters"
Healthcare: Share patient data for research without privacy risks
Finance: Test models on realistic but synthetic transaction data
Government: Enable data-driven policy while protecting citizen privacy
